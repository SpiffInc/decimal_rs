# DecimalRs

⚠️ This Library is not ready to be used.
This is an early concept for an alternative approach to [mpdecimal](https://github.com/SpiffInc/mpdecimal).
It aims to provide some advanced functionality for fixed-precision decimal math, but with the use of rustler to aid in memory safety and correctness.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `decimal_rs` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:decimal_rs, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/decimal_rs>.
